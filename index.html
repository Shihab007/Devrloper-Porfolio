            <h3>Dream chaser and Never give up</h3>
            <p>Naruto Uzumaki is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan. He became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on
                the
                day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood.
                After
                joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his
                dream to become Hokage.</p>
